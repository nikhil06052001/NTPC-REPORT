# NTPC-REPORT
I successfully completed my industrial training at NTPC Unchahar, a prestigious and fully operational Maharatna government firm dedicated to supplying 1500 MW of power to India.
I was fortunate to receive an offer to work there and gained knowledge about the functioning of the plant, their protective measures, daily obstacles, and operations and services.
This plant consists of 5 units that collectively generate 1500MW of power using coal-based operations using the Rankine cycle.
This location has provided me with valuable knowledge and insights into industrial behavior and duties, which I consider a significant accomplishment that will benefit me throughout my life.
